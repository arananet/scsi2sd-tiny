# SCSI2SD

SCSI2SD is an open project made by Michael McMaster that replace your old SCSI drive device with a SCSI emulator using micro-sd.

# SCSI-TINY

I made this new tiny design from the original SCSI2SD schematics using EAGLE PCB Software. This is a working and tested design by many users. They are on sale in AmigaStore and also a batch has been made in 2018 for the RETROWIKI forum.

# Updates

25/10/2019: Initial release. HW made in 2018.

# License

As Michael stated on his web page http://www.codesrc.com/mediawiki/index.php/SCSI2SD.

Older versions of the SCSI2SD hardware designs were published under the GPL licence. This permits anyone to build their own board from the original or modified designs, so long as they abide by the licence terms.

## The source/designs of any modifications must be provided to those you distribute the board to.

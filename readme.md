# SCSI2SD

SCSI2SD is an open project made by Michael McMaster that replace your old SCSI drive device with a SCSI emulator using micro-sd.

# SCSI-TINY

I made this new tiny design from the original SCSI2SD schematics using EAGLE PCB Software. This particular design contains two SD sockets, one for micro-sd and one for SD. This is a working and tested design by many users. They are on sale in AmigaStore and also a batch has been made in 2018 for the RETROWIKI forum.
